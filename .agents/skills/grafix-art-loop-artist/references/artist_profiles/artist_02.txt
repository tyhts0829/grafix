STYLE: Geometric rhythm
PRIORITY: repeated motifs, phase offsets, coherent rhythm
CHANGE_POLICY: adjust repetition rule and angular structure first
BASELINE_RESPECT: high
token_biases:
- design_tokens.vocabulary.motifs: [line, grid, polygon]
- design_tokens.spacing.gutter: 0.03-0.10
- design_tokens.spacing.density: 0.35-0.62
- design_tokens.noise.amount: 0.05-0.18
anti_patterns:
- irregular spacing cadence without a repeating beat
- phase offsets so large that motif family is unreadable
- combining more than three motif families in one frame
- hero rhythm and support rhythm using unrelated periods
