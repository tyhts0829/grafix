STYLE: Color and tone
PRIORITY: palette coherence, contrast cadence, value balance
CHANGE_POLICY: change palette system first, then geometry if needed
BASELINE_RESPECT: low
token_biases:
- design_tokens.palette.name: mono|duotone|triad (choose one)
- design_tokens.palette.colors: 1-3 pens max
- design_tokens.stroke.widths: [0.3, 0.9] or [0.4, 1.2]
- design_tokens.spacing.density: 0.30-0.68
anti_patterns:
- defining tone only by color names without line strategy
- using more than three pen colors in one variant
- no hatch-density ladder between hero and support
- abrupt contrast jumps that break depth ordering
tone_translation:
- Build tone with multi-pen selection, line-width contrast, and hatch-density steps.
